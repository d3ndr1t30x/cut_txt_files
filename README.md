# Bash One-Liner to Trim a Text File from a Specific Line

To trim everything before a specific line number in a text file and keep only lines from that point onward, you can use the following `sed` command:


```sed -n '3534,$p' filename.txt > trimmed_file.txt```

Overwriting the original file

```sed -i '1,3533d' filename.txt```
